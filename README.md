# 🤖 AI Agent Projects

A collection of AI agent projects built with Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK), featuring multi-agent systems, custom tools, and real-world deployments.

## 🚀 Projects

### 1. Single Agents
- Basic AI agent with Gemini integration
- Google Search tool integration
- Error handling and retry logic

### 2. Multi-Agent Systems  
- **Sequential Workflows**: Blog post creation pipeline
- **Parallel Execution**: Simultaneous agent processing
- **Loop Patterns**: Iterative refinement systems
- **Dynamic Routing**: LLM-powered agent management

### 3. Tools & MCP 
- **Custom Tools**: Currency converter, payment calculators
- **MCP Integration**: External service connection patterns  
- **Long-Running Operations**: Human approval workflows
- **Production Patterns**: Resumable workflows, tool context management

### 4. Memory Management 

#### Session Management (Working Memory)
- **Context Engineering**: Smart LLM context assembly & compaction
- **Sessions & Events**: Maintain conversation history across multiple turns
- **Persistent Storage**: Database-backed sessions that survive restarts
- **Session State**: Track structured data during conversations
- **Production Patterns**: Real-time vs batch memory saving strategies

#### Long-Term Memory Systems
- **MemoryService Architecture**: Permanent knowledge storage
- **Memory Operations**: Add, search, and retrieve from memory
- **Memory Consolidation**: Extract key insights from conversations
- **Proactive vs Reactive**: Preload vs on-demand memory retrieval
- **Enterprise Integration**: Vertex AI Memory Bank patterns
